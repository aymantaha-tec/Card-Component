Live  Solution  Challenge
Solution for a challenge from frontendmentor.io.
This HTML & CSS only challenge is perfect for anyone just starting out or anyone wanting a small project to play around with. The main challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for interactive elements



I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Desktop-first workflow
What I learned
There was nothing knew I did not know before however the hover effect was a bit a challange. It was hard to change the color and hover image at the same time. Managed to find the way and learned that I can actually use background image and background color at the same time in the same tag!

Useful resources
Figma - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
Perfect Pixel - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
